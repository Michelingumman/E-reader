It seems absurd, in\nsome sense, even to think about anything else but that illness\nduring this trying time. Nonetheless, binding all the thoughts\ncontained in any current work to the existence of the pandemic—\nwhich too shall pass—seems like an error, as the normal problems\nof life will return at some point (and thankfully) to the forefront.\nThat all means that an author of the present day is inevitably going\nto make one mistake (concentrating too much on the pandemic,\nwhich has an uncertain life span, and producing a book that is\ninstantly dated, in consequence) or another (ignoring the pandemic,\nwhich is very much like failing to attend to the proverbial elephant\nunder the rug).\nAfter considering this, as well as discussing the issues with my\npublishers, I decided to write Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life\naccording to the plan laid out for it several years ago, and to\nconcentrate on addressing issues not specific to the current time\n(thus, to risk the second error rather than the first). I suppose it\nmay also be the case that those who have chosen to read this book\nor listen to the audio version might be relieved to turn their\nattention to something other than the coronavirus and the\ndevastation it has wrought.\n"

I had six-inch tethers attaching me to the\nsides of the bed because, in my unconscious state, I had been\nagitated enough to try to remove the catheters from my arm and\nleave the ICU. I was confused and frustrated not knowing where I\nwas, surrounded by people speaking a foreign language, and in the\nabsence of my daughter, Mikhaila, and her husband, Andrey, who\nwere restricted to short visiting hours and did not have permission\nto be there with me at my moment of wakening. I was angry, too,\nabout being there, and lunged at my daughter when she did visit\nseveral hours later. I felt betrayed, although that was the furthest\nfrom the truth. People had been attending to my various needs with\ngreat diligence, and in the wake of the tremendous logistic\nchallenges that come about from seeking medical care in a truly\nforeign country. I do not have any memory of anything that\nhappened to me during the most recent weeks preceding that, and\nvery little between that moment and my having entered a hospital\nin Toronto, in mid-December. One of the few things I could recall,\nlooking back to the earliest days of the year, was the time I had\nspent writing this book.\nI wrote much and edited almost all of Beyond Order during a\ntime when my family was plagued by sequential and overlapping\nbouts of seriously impaired health, much of which was the subject\nof public discussion, and for that reason requires some detailed\nexplanation. First, in January 2019, Mikhaila had to seek out a\nsurgeon to replace much of her artificial ankle, implanted about a\ndecade earlier, as the initial installation was never perfect, causing\nher serious pain and trouble with movement as a consequence, and\n"

I spent a week with her at a hospital in\nZurich, Switzerland, for the week of that procedure and her initial\nrecovery.\nAt the beginning of March, my wife, Tammy, underwent routine\nsurgery in Toronto for a common and eminently treatable kidney\ncancer. A month and a half after that surgery, which involved the\nremoval of one third of the organ in question, we learned that she\nwas actually suffering from an extremely rare malignancy, which\nhad a one-year fatality rate of close to 100 percent.\nTwo weeks later, the surgeons involved in her care removed the\nremaining two thirds of her afflicted kidney, along with a\nsubstantial proportion of the related abdominal lymphatic system.\nThe surgery appeared to bring the progression of the cancer to a\nhalt, but produced leakage of fluid (up to four liters, or one gallon, a\nday) from her now-damaged lymphatic system—a condition known\nas chylous ascites—which rivaled the original condition in danger.\nWe journeyed to see a medical team in Philadelphia, where within\nninety-six hours of the initial injection of a poppy seed oil dye,\nwhose practical purpose was the enhancement of images derived\nfrom CAT or MRI scans, the complete cessation of Tammy’s fluid\nloss was achieved. This breakthrough occurred on the very day of\nour thirtieth wedding anniversary. She recovered rapidly and, to all\nappearances, completely—a testament to the luck without which\nnone of us can live, and to her own admirable strength and\nresistance.\nUnfortunately, while these events unfolded, my health fell apart.\nI had begun to take an antianxiety agent at the beginning of 2017,\nafter suffering from what appeared to be an autoimmune reaction to\nsomething I had consumed during the Christmas holiday period of\n2016.* The food reaction made me acutely and continually anxious,\nas well as freezing cold, no matter what clothes I was wearing or\nhow many blankets I layered upon myself. Further, it lowered my\nblood pressure so dramatically that whenever I tried to stand I\nwould gray out and be forced into a crouch half a dozen or more\ntimes before trying again. I also experienced insomnia that appeared\nnear total. My family physician prescribed a benzodiazepine as well\n"

I took the latter a mere handful of times\nbefore ceasing its use entirely; the terrible symptoms I was\nexperiencing, including the insomnia, were almost immediately and\nentirely eradicated by the benzodiazepine treatment, making the\nsleep agent unnecessary. I continued the benzodiazepine for almost\nexactly three years, because my life did seem unnaturally stressful\nduring that time (the period when my life changed from the quiet\nexistence of a university professor and clinician to the tumultuous\nreality of a public figure), and because I believed that this drug was\n—as is often claimed of benzodiazepines—a relatively harmless\nsubstance.\nThings changed, however, in March 2019, at the onset of my\nwife’s medical battle. My anxiety spiked noticeably after Mikhaila’s\naforementioned hospitalization, surgery, and recovery. In\nconsequence, I asked my family physician to increase my dose of\nbenzodiazepine, so that I would not be preoccupied by nor\npreoccupy others with my anxiety. Unfortunately, I experienced a\nmarked increase in negative emotion following the adjustment. I\nasked to have the dosage raised yet again (by this time, we were\nattempting to deal with the second of Tammy’s surgeries and its\ncomplications, and I attributed my even more severe anxiety to that\nproblem), but my anxiety increased even further. I attributed all of\nthis not to a paradoxical reaction to the medication (which it was\nlater diagnosed as), but to the recurrence of a tendency toward\ndepression that had plagued me for years.* In any case, I ceased\nusing the benzodiazepine entirely in May of that year, trying two\ndoses of ketamine within a week, as suggested by a psychiatrist with\nwhom I consulted. Ketamine, a nonstandard anesthetic/psychedelic,\nsometimes has overwhelming and sudden positive effects on\ndepression. It produced nothing for me but two ninety-minute trips\nto hell. I felt to my bones as if I had everything to feel guilty and\nashamed about, with nothing gained by my positive experiences.\nA few days after the second ketamine experience, I began to\nsuffer the effects of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal, which were\ntruly intolerable—anxiety far beyond what I had ever experienced,\nan uncontrollable restlessness and need to move (formally known\n"

A family friend—a\nphysician—enlightened me as to the dangers of sudden\nbenzodiazepine withdrawal. I therefore started to take a\nbenzodiazepine once again—but a smaller dose than I had climbed\nto previously. Many, but not all, of my symptoms abated. To deal\nwith those that remained, I also began to take an antidepressant\nthat had been of great use to me in the past. All it did, however, was\nmake me exhausted enough to require an additional four or more\nhours of sleep a day—which was not helpful in the midst of\nTammy’s serious health issues—as well as increase my appetite two-\nor threefold.\nAfter about three months of terrible anxiety, uncontrollable\nhypersomnia, viciously torturous akathisia, and excessive appetite, I\ntraveled to an American clinic that claimed to specialize in rapid\nbenzodiazepine withdrawal. Despite the good intentions of many of\nits psychiatrists, the clinic managed only a slow cessation or\ntapering of my benzodiazepine dosage, the negative effects of which\nI was already experiencing and which were not and could not be\ncontrolled to any significant degree whatsoever by the inpatient\ntreatment offered.\nI resided at that clinic, nonetheless, from mid-August, a mere few\ndays after Tammy had recovered from her postsurgical\ncomplications, to late November, when I returned home to Toronto,\nmuch the worse for wear. By this time, the akathisia (the disorder of\nuncontrollable movement alluded to earlier) had increased to the\npoint where I could not sit or rest in any position for any length of\ntime whatsoever without severe distress. In December I checked in\nto a local hospital, and it was at that point that my awareness of\nevents prior to my awakening in Moscow ends. As I later learned,\nMikhaila and Andrey removed me from the Toronto hospital in\nearly January 2020, believing that the treatment I received there\nwas doing me more harm than good (an opinion I concurred with\nentirely once I learned of it).\nThe situation I found myself in upon reattaining consciousness in\nRussia was complicated by the fact that I had also developed double\n"

However, I was there\nprimarily so that the clinic could facilitate my withdrawal from\nbenzodiazepines, using a procedure either unknown or regarded as\ntoo dangerous in North America. Since I had not been able to\ntolerate any decrease in dosage whatsoever—apart from the initial\nreduction, months before—the clinic placed me in a medically\ninduced coma so that I might remain unconscious during the very\nworst withdrawal symptoms. That regimen started January 5 and\nlasted nine days, during which I was also placed in a machine so\nthat my breathing was mechanically regulated. On January 14, I was\ntaken off the anesthetic and the intubation. I woke up for a few\nhours, and indicated during this time to Mikhaila that I was no\nlonger suffering from akathisia, although I remember nothing of\nthis.\nOn January 23, I was moved to another ICU specializing in\nneurological rehabilitation. I can recall waking up on the twenty-\nsixth for a short period, until my more complete return to\nconsciousness, as previously related, on February 5—ten days\nduring which I passed through a period of delirium of vivid\nintensity. Once that cleared, I moved to a more homelike\nrehabilitation center in the outer suburbs of Moscow.

A few weeks later, after the problems\nin perception and coordination had essentially abated, Mikhaila,\nAndrey, their child, and I relocated to Florida for what we hoped\nwould be some peaceful time of recuperation in the sun (very much\nwelcome after the cold grayness of midwinter Moscow).

And I believe that if I had fallen prey to\nresentment, for example, I would have perished once and for all—\nand that I am fortunate to have avoided such a fate.\nIs it not possible (even though it may not always deliver us from\nthe terrible situation that we find ourselves in) that we would all be\nmore able to deal with uncertainty, the horrors of nature, the\ntyranny of culture, and the malevolence of ourselves and others if\nwe were better and more courageous people?

When such attempts go too far,\ntotalitarianism threatens, driven by the desire to exercise full\ncontrol where such control is not possible, even in principle. This\nmeans risking a dangerous restriction of all the psychological and\nsocial changes necessary to maintain adaptation to the ever-\nchanging world. And so we find ourselves inescapably faced with the\nneed to move beyond order, into its opposite: chaos.\nIf order is where what we want makes itself known—when we act\nin accordance with our hard-won wisdom—chaos is where what we\ndo not expect or have remained blind to leaps forward from the\npotential that surrounds us. The fact that something has occurred\nmany times in the past is no guarantee that it will continue to occur\nin the same manner.1 There exists, eternally, a domain beyond what\nwe know and can predict. Chaos is anomaly, novelty,\nunpredictability, transformation, disruption, and all too often,\ndescent, as what we have come to take for granted reveals itself as\nunreliable. Sometimes it manifests itself gently, revealing its\nmysteries in experience that makes us curious, compelled, and\ninterested. This is particularly likely, although not inevitable, when\nwe approach what we do not understand voluntarily, with careful\npreparation and discipline. Other times the unexpected makes itself\nknown terribly, suddenly, accidentally, so we are undone, and fall\napart, and can only put ourselves back together with great difficulty\n—if at all.\nNeither the state of order nor the state of chaos is preferable,\nintrinsically, to the other. That is the wrong way to look at it.\nNonetheless, in my previous book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to\nChaos, I focused more on how the consequences of too much chaos\nmight be remediated.2 We respond to sudden and unpredictable\nchange by preparing, physiologically and psychologically, for the\nworst. And because only God Himself knows what this worst might\nbe, we must in our ignorance prepare for all eventualities. And the\nproblem with that continual preparation is that, in excess, it\nexhausts us.

I have watched her\ncarefully while she develops, trying to understand what she is up to\nand playing along with it. When she was about a year and a half old,\nshe engaged in all manner of unbearably endearing behaviors—\ngiggling and laughing when she was poked, high-fiving, bumping\nheads, and rubbing noses. However, in my opinion, the most\nnoteworthy of all the actions she undertook at that age was her\npointing.\nShe had discovered her index finger, using it to specify all the\nobjects in the world she found interesting. She delighted in doing\nso, particularly when her pointing called forth the attention of the\nadults surrounding her.

She thrived on that, and no wonder.\nWe compete for attention, personally, socially, and economically.\nNo currency has a value that exceeds it. Children, adults, and\nsocieties wither on the vine in its absence. To have others attend to\nwhat you find important or interesting is to validate, first, the\nimportance of what you are attending to, but second, and more\ncrucially, to validate you as a respected center of conscious\nexperience and contributor to the collective world. Pointing is, as\nwell, a crucial precursor to the development of language. To name\nsomething—to use the word for the thing—is essentially to point to\nit, to specify it against everything else, to isolate it for use\nindividually and socially.\nWhen my granddaughter pointed, she did it publicly. When she\npointed to something, she could immediately observe how the\npeople close to her reacted. There is just not that much point, so to\nspeak, in pointing to something that no one else cares about.

To name something is not only to\nmake it shine forth against the infinite background of potentially\nnameable things, but to group or categorize it, simultaneously, with\nmany other phenomena of its broad utility or significance. We use\nthe word “floor,” for example, but do not generally employ a\nseparate word for all the floors we might encounter (concrete, wood,\nearth, glass), much less all the endless variations of color and\ntexture and shade that make up the details of the floors that bear\nour weight.

His strength, however, is\nprecisely his willingness to risk such a drop; to risk being once again\nat the bottom. No one unwilling to be a foolish beginner can learn.\nIt was for this reason, among others, that Carl Jung regarded the\nFool as the archetypal precursor to the figure of the equally\narchetypal Redeemer, the perfected individual.\nThe beginner, the fool, is continually required to be patient and\ntolerant—with himself and, equally, with others. His displays of\nignorance, inexperience, and lack of skill may still sometimes be\nrightly attributed to irresponsibility and condemned, justly, by\nothers. But the insufficiency of the fool is often better regarded as\nan inevitable consequence of each individual’s essential\nvulnerability, rather than as a true moral failing.

Consider, for example, the\nDisney heroes Pinocchio and Simba, as well as J. K. Rowling’s\nmagical Harry Potter.

Great mythologized heroes often come into the world,\nlikewise, in the most meager of circumstances (as the child of an\nIsraelite slave, for example, or newborn in a lowly manger) and in\ngreat danger (consider the Pharaoh’s decision to slay all the\nfirstborn male babies of the Israelites, and Herod’s comparable\nedict, much later). But today’s beginner is tomorrow’s master. Thus,\nit is necessary even for the most accomplished (but who wishes to\naccomplish still more) to retain identification with the as yet\nunsuccessful; to appreciate the striving toward competence; to\ncarefully and with true humility subordinate him or herself to the\ncurrent game; and to develop the knowledge, self-control, and\ndiscipline necessary to make the next move.\n"

First, we might come to\nunderstand consciously that these two modes of being are integrally\ninterdependent. One cannot truly exist without the other, although\nthey exist in genuine tension.

Thus, just as the hierarchy of\nassumptions that make up the structure that organizes society and\nindividual perceptions is shaped by, and integrally dependent on,\nrestrictions, so too is creative transformation. It must strain against\nlimits. It has no use and cannot be called forth unless it is struggling\nagainst something. It is for this reason that the great genie, the\ngranter of wishes—God, in a microcosm—is archetypally trapped in\nthe tiny confines of a lamp and subject, as well, to the will of the\nlamp’s current holder.

What lurks, therefore, under the explicitly stated desire for\ncomplete freedom—as expressed, say, by the anarchist, or the\nnihilist—is not a positive desire, striving for enhanced creative\nexpression, as in the romanticized caricature of the artist. It is\ninstead a negative desire—a desire for the complete absence of\nresponsibility, which is simply not commensurate with genuine\nfreedom. This is the lie of objections to the rules.

If that analysis is\nsuccessful, we can generalize across anecdotes with the formulation\nof rules, and then we can learn, consciously, to follow those rules.\nHere is how this might happen. We all react judgmentally when a\nchild or adult—or, indeed, a society—is acting improperly, unfairly,\nor badly. The error strikes us emotionally. We intuit that a pattern\nupon which individual and social adaptation depends has been\ndisrupted and violated. We are annoyed, frustrated, hurt, or grief-\nstricken at the betrayal. This does not mean that each of us, reacting\nemotionally, has been successful at articulating a comprehensive\nphilosophy of good and evil. We may never put our finger on what\nhas gone wrong. However, like children unfamiliar with a new game\nbut still able to play it, we know that the rules are being broken.\nSomething precisely like this is portrayed in the biblical story of\nExodus, the ancient account of the flight of the Hebrew slaves from\ntheir Egyptian masters. Moses, who leads the escaping people, is\ncontinually called upon by his followers to draw very fine moral\ndistinctions when they struggle with one another and seek his\nadvice. In consequence, he spends a very long time observing and\ncontemplating their behavior. It is as if the desert prophet had to\ndiscover what rules he and his Israelite followers were already\nstruggling to act out, prior to his receipt of the explicit\ncommandments from God. Remember: Every society is already\ncharacterized by patterned behavior; otherwise it would be pure\nconflict and no “society” at all. But the mere fact that social order\nreigns to some degree does not mean that a given society has come\nto explicitly understand its own behavior, its own moral code. It is\ntherefore no accident that in this story Moses serves as a judge for\nhis followers—and does so with sufficient duration and intensity to\nexhaust himself—before he receives the Ten Commandments:\nAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to\njudge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the\nmorning unto the evening.\n"

J. K. Rowling, the series author, takes\nsome pains to describe a sporting event, Quidditch, which helps to\ndefine and unify Hogwarts. The point of Quidditch is to drive a ball\n(the Quaffle) through one of the three hoops guarded by the\nopposing team, while flying about the playing pitch on enchanted\nbrooms.

What does her narrative idea signify? There are two ways\nof answering these questions (although both answers relate\nimportantly to each other):\nFirst: In Rule I, we discussed the idea that the true winner of any\ngame is the person who plays fair. This is because playing fair,\ndespite the particularities of any given game, is a higher-order\naccomplishment than mere victory.

Thus, the ethical player, like\nthe Seeker, indomitably pursues what is most valuable in the midst\nof complex, competing obligations.\nSecond: Among the alchemists, the round chaos was associated\nwith the winged god Mercury, who served as messenger from the\nrealm of the divine, guide of souls to the underworld, and bringer of\ngood fortune. It is for this reason that the ancient symbol for\nMercury is located at the very pinnacle (the most important\nlocation) of the image in question. It is an attempt to indicate what\nguides the process that the picture represents. Centuries ago, prior\nto the dawn of modern chemistry, the god Mercury represented\nwhat inspires or attracts interest involuntarily. He was the spirit\nwho possessed a person when his or her attention was drawn\nirresistibly to some person, situation, or event. Imagine that there\nare very complex processes going on in your mind unconsciously,\nhighlighting events of potential worth and distinguishing them from\neverything else constantly unfolding around you. Imagine that\nthose processes that distinguish value are alive, which is certainly\nthe case, and that they are complex and integrated enough to be\nconceptualized as a personality. That is Mercury. The draw he exerts\non our attention reveals itself in a sense of significance—in the\nsense that something happening around you is worth attending to,\nor contains something of value. The Seeker—in real life, as well as\nin Rowling’s Potter series and its Quidditch game—is he or she who\ntakes that sense of significance more seriously than anything else.\nThe Seeker is therefore the person who is playing the game that\neveryone else is playing (and who is disciplined and expert at the\ngame), but who is also playing an additional, higher-order game: the\npursuit of what is of primary significance. The Snitch (like the\nround chaos) can therefore be considered the “container” of that\n"

Thus, an\neternal question emerges whenever people of different backgrounds\nare required to deal with one another on a relatively permanent\nbasis: What do all gods share that makes them gods? What is God,\nin essence?\nThat is a very difficult question. It is, on the one hand, the\nquestion of value: What is of the highest importance? It is, on the\nother hand, the question of sovereignty: What principle should\nrule? These are the questions posed by those pondering the\nultimate source of divine significance itself. Their difficulty meant\nthat they, and by extension the question of God, had to be answered\nover centuries, over millennia. The answer emerged first in story\nform. The Mesopotamians brilliantly intuited that the highest god—\nthe highest good—involved careful attention (the multiple, head-\ncircling eyes of Marduk) and effective language (the magic words of\nMarduk, capable of generating a cosmos), in addition to the courage\nand strength to voluntarily confront and overcome chaos, the\nunknown.

Then he returns home,\nenemies in tow. His compatriots celebrate his victory and accede yet\nmore completely to his leadership, before he assigns them their\nvarious duties. Then, after consulting Ea, the god of wisdom,\nMarduk determines to create man, to aid the gods most\nfundamentally in the eternal task of maintaining the proper balance\nbetween order and chaos—to release those very gods from their\nservice, and to transfer their burden onto our all-too-human\nshoulders.*\nThe basic story is this: when order (Apsu) is carelessly threatened\nor destroyed, the terrible forces of chaos from which the world was\noriginally derived appear once again in their most destructive,\nmonstrous, predatory guise. Then a hero, representing the highest\nof values, must arise or be elected to confront this chaotic force. He\ndoes so successfully, deriving or producing something of great\nworth.

It is in this way that the spirit of Marduk\nstill possesses each individual who engages courageously in the\nprocesses of encounter and confrontation that eternally create and\nrenew society. It is this that happens when each small child learns\nto regulate and unite his emotions and motivations into a coherent\npersonality, and then goes out to challenge the unknown world.\nIn slightly altered form, this is the story of St. George: The\ninhabitants of an ancient city must obtain water from a well beside\nthe nest of a dragon.

The young women of the city\ndraw lots when the supply of sheep is exhausted. One day it is the\ndaughter of the king herself who loses. St. George appears,\nconfronts the dragon with the sign of the cross—symbol of the\neternal Redeemer, the archetypal hero—and frees the doomed\nprincess.

The cross, for its part, is the burden of life. It is a place of\nbetrayal, torture, and death. It is therefore a fundamental symbol of\nmortal vulnerability. In the Christian drama, it is also the place\nwhere vulnerability is transcended, as a consequence of its\nacceptance. This voluntary acceptance is also equivalent to victory\nover the dragon, representation of chaos, death, and the unknown.\nBy accepting life’s suffering, therefore, evil may be overcome. The\nalternative is hell, at least in its psychological form: rage,\nresentment, and the desire for revenge and destruction.\nThe same story is echoed in the tales of St. Patrick, who chases\nthe snakes out of Ireland, and St. Michael, who defeats the Christian\nequivalent of Kingu, “that ancient serpent called the devil”\n"

No doubt the greatest of our ancestors\nwere beginning to threaten snakes with sticks when we still lived in\ntrees. No doubt it was those voluntarily snake-chasing ancestors\nwho reaped the benefits of their bravery in the form of nearby\ngrateful maidens (or their ancestral arboreal equivalents)—and\nperhaps this is why dragons hoard virgins, as well as gold. What\nconstitutes the worst of all snakes and the stoutest of all sticks,\nhowever, might be regarded as the central religious questions of\nhumanity. It is interesting to note that in The Hobbit, the worst\nsnake is “only” a dragon, but in The Lord of the Rings, the worst\nsnake, so to speak, is the much more abstract evil of the wizard\nSauron.

In consequence, if\nthere was something about it that was chronically bothersome, even\nin a minor sort of way, it needed to be attended to. Second, it is very\ncommon to allow so-called minor irritations (which are not minor,\nas I said, if they happen constantly) to continue for years without\ncomment or resolution.\nHere is the problem: Collect a hundred, or a thousand, of those,\nand your life is miserable and your marriage doomed. Do not\npretend you are happy with something if you are not, and if a\nreasonable solution might, in principle, be negotiated. Have the\ndamn fight.

I presumed initially that her\nunhappiness stemmed from anxiety about her career transition. But\nshe managed that move without a hitch during the time we\ncontinued our sessions, while other issues rose to the forefront.\nHer problem was not her career change. It was her marriage. She\ndescribed her husband as extraordinarily self-centered and\nsimultaneously overly concerned with how he appeared in the eyes\nof others. It was a contradictory combination, in some manner,\nalthough it is common enough to see this touching of opposites in a\npersonality: If you lean too far in one direction, something else in\nyou leans equally far in the other. So, despite the husband’s\nnarcissism (at least from his wife’s perspective), he was in thrall to\nthe opinions of everyone he met—excepting the members of his\nown family. He also drank too much—a habit which exaggerated his\ntemperamental defects.\nMy client was not comfortable in her own home. She did not feel\nthere was anything truly of her within the apartment she shared\nwith her husband (the couple had no children). Her situation\nprovided a good example of how what is outside can profoundly\nreflect what is inside (which is why I suggest to people who are in\npsychological trouble that they might begin their recovery by\ncleaning up—and then beautifying, if possible—their rooms). All\ntheir household furnishings, which she described as showy, ornate,\nand uncomfortable, had been chosen by her husband.

She tended\ntoward a minimalist aesthetic (or perhaps that preference was a\nconsequence of her husband’s decorative excesses). It was never\nquite clear what she might have preferred, and perhaps that was\npart of the problem: because she did not know what she liked (and\nwas equally vague about her dislikes), she was not in the strongest\nposition to put forward her own opinions.

Dissociation of thought and action is\nnecessary for abstract thought even to exist. Thus, we can clearly\nthink or say one thing and do another. This is fine when merely\nthinking, prior to acting, but perhaps not so good when we promise\nor claim to believe something and then act in a manner indicating\nthat we truly have faith in something else.

Perhaps this is because there are always good\nthings we are not doing; some sins of omission are therefore\ninevitable. In any case, there are still times when willful blindness\nnonetheless produces more serious catastrophes, more easily\nrationalized away, than the active or the unconscious repression of\nsomething terrible but understood (the latter being a sin of\ncommission, because it is known).

The proper place for such a hole is\ndead center, right on target. The ride is likely to be very bumpy,\notherwise—with the bumps directly proportional in magnitude to\nthe degree of offset. This is quite reminiscent, to me, of the Greek\nterm hamartia, which is frequently translated as “sin,” in the\ncontext of Christian thought.\nHamartia was originally an archery term, and it meant to miss\nthe mark or target. There are many ways that a target can be missed.\nFrequently, in my clinical practice—and in my personal life—I\nobserved that people did not get what they needed (or, equally\nimportantly perhaps, what they wanted) because they never made it\nclear to themselves or others what that was.

He is potential itself, like every child, and that\nmakes him magical, in the same way that every child is magical. But\ntime whittles that magic away, transforming the fascinating\npotentiality of childhood into the oft-apparently more mundane but\ngenuine actuality of adulthood. The trick, so to speak, is to trade\nthat early possibility for something meaningful, productive, long\nterm, and sustainable. Peter Pan refuses to do so.

My client tried to make sense\nof what she was witnessing: “Such discussions give people the\nsuperficial sense of being good, noble, compassionate, openhearted,\nand wise.

Nietzsche did not make this claim in a narcissistic or\ntriumphant manner. The great thinker’s opinion stemmed from his\nfear that all the Judeo-Christian values serving as the foundation of\nWestern civilization had been made dangerously subject to casual\nrational criticism, and that the most important axiom upon which\nthey were predicated—the existence of a transcendent, all-powerful\ndeity—had been fatally challenged. Nietzsche concluded from this\nthat everything would soon fall apart, in a manner catastrophic both\npsychologically and socially.\nIt does not require a particularly careful reader to note that\nNietzsche described God, in The Gay Science, as the “holiest and\nmightiest of all that the world has yet owned,” and modern human\nbeings as “the murderers of all murderers.”1 These are not the sorts\nof descriptions you might expect from a triumphant rationalist\ncelebrating the demise of superstition. It was instead a statement of\nabsolute despair. In his other works, particularly in The Will to\nPower, Nietzsche describes what would occur in the next century\nand beyond because of this murderous act.2 He prophesied (and\nthat is the correct word for it) that two major consequences would\narise—apparent opposites, although each linked inextricably and\ncausally together—and both associated with the death of traditional\nritual, story, and belief.\nAs the purpose of human life became uncertain outside the\npurposeful structure of monotheistic thought and the meaningful\nworld it proposed, we would experience an existentially devastating\nrise in nihilism, Nietzsche believed. Alternatively, he suggested,\npeople would turn to identification with rigid, totalitarian ideology:\nthe substitute of human ideas for the transcendent Father of All\nCreation.

The\nappearance of these ideals was not a positive development, in\nDostoevsky’s view. He could see that the adoption of a rigid,\ncomprehensive utopian ideology, predicated on a few apparently\nself-evident axioms, presented a political and spiritual danger with\nthe potential to far exceed in brutality all that had occurred in the\nreligious, monarchical, or even pagan past. Dostoyevsky, like\nNietzsche, foresaw that all of this was coming almost fifty years (!)\nbefore the Leninist Revolution in Russia. That incomprehensible\nlevel of prophetic capacity remains a stellar example of how the\nartist and his intuition brings to light the future far before others\nsee it.\nNietzsche and Dostoevsky both foresaw that communism would\nappear dreadfully attractive—an apparently rational, coherent, and\nmoral alternative to religion or nihilism—and that the consequences\nwould be lethal.

It is for this reason that an apprenticeship ends with a\nmasterpiece, the creation of which signifies not only the acquisition\nof the requisite skill, but the acquisition of the ability to create new\nskills.\nAlthough Christ commits many acts that might be considered\nrevolutionary, as we discussed in Rule I, He is nonetheless explicitly\nportrayed in the Gospels as the master of tradition, and says of\nHimself, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the\nprophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill” (Matthew 5:17,\nKJV). The New International Version of the Bible perhaps puts it\nmore comprehensibly: “Do not think that I have come to abolish the\nLaw or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill\nthem.” Christ therefore presents Himself as both the product of\ntradition, and the very thing that creates and transforms it. The\nsame pattern of creative conflict pervades the Old Testament, which\nis in large part a series of stories about the spirit in prophetic\nopposition to the inevitable corruption of dogma harnessed to serve\npower. It is the personality who mimics that model who might be\nregarded as truly Western, in the deepest of psychological senses.\nIf you work as hard as you can on one thing, you will change. You\nwill start to also become one thing, instead of the clamoring\nmultitude you once were. That one thing, developed properly, is not\nonly the disciplined entity formed by sacrifice, commitment, and\nconcentration. It is that which creates, destroys, and transforms\ndiscipline itself—civilization itself—by expressing its unity of\npersonality and society. It is the very Word of truth, upon whose\nfunction all habitable order, wrenched out of chaos, eternally\ndepends.\nWork as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see\nwhat happens.\n"

In the living room hung some large\npaintings (not to everyone’s taste, certainly: they were Soviet\nrealist/impressionist pieces, some illustrating the Second World\nWar, some representing the triumph of communism), as well as a\nvariety of cubist miniatures and South American pieces heavily\ninfluenced by the native tradition. Prior to our recent renovations\nthe room had held at least twenty-five paintings, including about\nfifteen smaller pieces (12” x 12”). There was even one—reminiscent\nof a medieval etching, although painted on canvas—on the ceiling,\nwhere I had attached it with magnets. It was from a Romanian\nchurch.

The Soviet era produced its own impressionism, often\ndepicting landscapes, rougher and harsher than the classic French\nversions but much to my taste and reminiscent of where I grew up\nin western Canada.

They blend together. At one point in the\npast, this presented a serious problem to biologists needing to\nobserve individual animals for enough time to derive some\nconclusions about their behavior. They would watch a wildebeest,\nlook away for a moment to make notes, and be unable to locate the\nsame animal when they glanced back up.\nEventually, they settled on a potential solution. The biologists\ndrove up adjacent to the herd in a Jeep, armed with a bucket of red\npaint and a stick with a rag on it. They dabbed a red spot on one of\nthe wildebeest’s haunches. Now they could track the activities of\nthat particular animal, and hopefully learn something new about\nwildebeest behavior. But guess what happened to the wildebeest,\nnow differentiated from the herd? The predators, always lurking\naround the herd, took it down. Lions—a major wildebeest threat—\ncannot easily bring a single wildebeest down unless they can\nidentify it. They cannot hunt a blur of indistinguishable herd\nanimals. They cannot track down four wildebeest at a time. They\nmust organize their hunt around an identifiable individual. Thus,\nwhen lions go after the little ones or the ones that limp, they are not\nculling the weak, in some natural display of beneficial altruism.\nThey would rather dine on a nice, healthy, delicious, juicy\nwildebeest than one that is tiny, old, or ill. But they must be able to\nidentify their prey. What is the moral of the story? Make yourself\ncolorful, stand out, and the lions will take you down. And the lions\nare always there.\n"

A six-year-old is, after\nall, half again as old as a four-year-old, and from that younger\nchild’s perspective, perhaps more akin to an adult. But your cousin\nwas six—almost as much a child as you.

She was no\nlonger at risk for such treatment, in any obvious manner. And it\ncame as a great relief to her to reframe what had happened. She\ncould now consider it as a potential consequence of curiosity\nuntrammeled by adult attention. This shifted her view of her cousin,\nthe situation, and herself. She could now see the event from the\nperspective of an adult. This freed her from much of the terror and\nshame still associated with the memories, and it did so with\nremarkable rapidity.

Thirty times one hundred is\nthree thousand times. Is there not some possibility that you could\ndevote a fraction of all that time to perfecting your technique,\nseduction, communication, and lovemaking? What does it matter,\ntherefore, if you have fifteen miserable dates before managing one\nthat verges on acceptable? That is fifteen times out of a possible\nthree thousand. That is half a percent of the romantic time you\ncould possibly spend together. Maybe you could dare even more to\ndetermine if things could be set right between you. Why would you\npossibly assume that something as complex as maintaining a\nmarriage could be managed without commitment, practice, and\neffort?\n“So maybe the first date is wretched and horrible. You never want\nto repeat it but you do, because you would rather save your\nmarriage than quit outright. And maybe the next one is five percent\nbetter. And maybe after some repeated attempts you remember for\nat least a brief moment why you once liked the person you married.\n"

People and their relationships are too complex to\nreduce to a single aspect—but it is still reasonable to note that a\ngood marriage is accompanied by mutual desire, mutually requited.\nUnfortunately, desire is not something that can be managed in\nisolation: “Let us fix our sex life” is a resolution too narrow in\nambition to fulfill its aim.\nThere must be a broader, relationship-wide strategy in place to\nmaintain romance with your partner across time.

It also gave rise to a line of mythological speculation,\nattempting to account for the strangeness of this creative act,\npredicated on the supposition that Adam, the original man produced\nby God, was hermaphroditic—half masculine and half feminine—\nand only later separated into the two sexes. This implies not only\nthe partition of a divinely produced unity, but the incompleteness of\nman and woman until each is brought together with the other.2 The\nfact that the candle is held jointly indicates the binding of the two\ncelebrants. The fact that the candle is held aloft, lit, implies that\nsomething higher—something superordinate—is representing or\nperforming the union.

Then you will have grandchildren so that you\nare surrounded by new life when yours begins to slip away. In our\nculture, we live as if we are going to die at thirty. But we do not. We\nlive a very long time, but it is also all over in a flash, and it should be\nthat you have accomplished what human beings accomplish when\nthey live a full life, and marriage and children and grandchildren\nand all the trouble and heartbreak that accompanies all of that is far\nmore than half of life.

You really have to work\nat it, and you will, if you are single, because you are lonesome,\nstarved for attention, and desperate for physical intimacy. (Single\npeople have far less sex, on average, than married people, although I\nsuppose that a small percentage are making out like bandits. But I\ncannot see that even those successful in that manner are doing\nthemselves any favors.)\nSo, as a single person, you will work at dating, because you are\nlonesome and deprived, but it is no simple matter. You must make\nspace in your life for it. You have to plan. You must use your\nimagination, spend money, find an acceptable dating partner, and,\nas they say, kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince (or to find a princess,\nas well).

This appears to strongly imply, in its\nnarrative way, that the burden of life can become so great that even\nGod Himself can lose faith when confronted with the unbearable\nreality of injustice, betrayal, suffering, and death.\nIt is hard to imagine a story more sympathetic to mere mortals. If\nGod Himself experiences doubts in the midst of His self-imposed\nagony, how could we mere humans not fall prey to the same failing?\nAnd it is possible that it was compassion that was driving the\nantinatalist Benatar’s position. I saw no evidence that Benatar was\nmalevolent in any obvious manner. He appeared to truly believe—in\na manner I found reminiscent of Goethe’s Mephistopheles—that the\ncombination of consciousness, vulnerability, and mortality is so dire\nthat there is simply no moral excuse for its continuance. Now, it is\nentirely possible that Mephistopheles’s opinion is not to be trusted.\nSince he is Satan himself, there is no reason to assume that the\nargument he puts forward to justify his adversarial stance toward\nBeing is valid, or even that he himself truly believes it. And perhaps\nthe same was true of Benatar, who was and is no doubt prey to the\nfrailties that characterize each of us (and that certainly includes me,\ndespite the stance I took in opposition to him). But I believed then\nand still firmly believe now that the consequences of his self-\nnegating position are simply too dire. It leads directly to an antilife\nor even an anti-Being nihilism so profound that its manifestation\ncould not help but exaggerate and amplify the destructive\n"

Many people,\nincluding Kelly and Joe Craft, Anish Dwivedi, Jamil Javani, Zach\nLahn, Chris Halverson, Metropolitan Jonah, and the V. Rev. Victor\nPotapov and Dimitir Ivanov, helped expedite what was a very\ncomplex, multidimensional process. While in Russia, my safety was\nensured by Alexander Usov, and my sense of isolation diminished\nby daily visits by Mikhaila and her husband, Andrey, who truly\ncannot be thanked enough. The Russian medical teams included\nIMC Addiction by Roman Yuzapolski, who agreed to supervise my\ncase despite being advised by assorted experts that it was too\ndangerous to do so, and his staff members, Herman Stepnov,\nadministrative directors, and Alexandr, therapist, who translated for\nme constantly for a two-week period, without even a change of\nclothes. The team of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences took\nme in with undiagnosed double pneumonia and in a state of\ncatatonia and delirium, and restored my ability to ambulate. Dr.\nMarina Petrova, the deputy director, and Dr. Michael, the head\ndoctor of what was known as the Reanimatology Ward, were of\nparticular and notable aid. Uliana Efros, nanny to my\ngranddaughter, Elizabeth Scarlett, always had our backs and\ntraveled with Mikhaila, Andrey, and me for eight months from\nRussia to Florida and Serbia, caring for Scarlett, including spending\na month in quarantine. Thanks as well to Uli’s daughter Liza\nRomanova, who helped take care of Scarlett in Russia, so that my\ndaughter and son-in-law could visit me in the hospital. Finally, on\nthe Russian end, I would like to thank Mikhail Avdeev, who helped\nus extensively with provision of medication and translation of\nmedical information—both on very short notice.\n"

        "content": "*Even rats understand this. Jaak Panksepp, one of the founders of the psychological subfield\ncalled affective neuroscience and an extremely creative, courageous, and gifted researcher,\nspent many years analyzing the role of play in the development and socialization of rats\n(see J. Panksepp, Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal\nEmotions [New York: Oxford University Press, 1998], particularly the chapter on play,\n280–99). Rats like to play. They particularly enjoy rough-and-tumble play, particularly if\nthey are male juvenile rats. They enjoy it so much that they will voluntarily work—pulling a\nlever repeatedly, say—to gain the opportunity to enter an arena where another juvenile\nwaits to play. When two juvenile strangers meet for the first time in this situation, they size\neach other up and then establish dominance. If one rat is only 10 percent larger than the\nother, he can pretty much win every physical contest, every rat wrestling match—but they\nstill wrestle to find out, and the larger rat almost inevitably pins the smaller. If you were\ninclined to view the establishment of hierarchy as equivalent to dominance by power, that\nwould be game over. The larger, more powerful rat won. End of story. But that is by no\nmeans the end of the story, unless the rats meet only once. Rats live in social environments,\nand they interact with the same individuals over and over. Thus, the game, once started,\ncontinues—and the rules have to govern not so much the single game as the repeating one.\nOnce dominance is established, the rats can play—something they do in a manner very\ndifferent from genuine fighting (just like play fighting with a pet dog is very different from\nbeing attacked by a dog). Now, the larger rat could pin the smaller rat every time. However,\nthat breaks the rules (really, the meta-rules: those that are observable only over the course\nof repeated games). The purpose of the repeated game is not dominance, but continuing\nplay. This is not to say that the initial dominance is without significance. It matters, not\nleast in the following manner: When the two rats meet a second time, they will both adopt\na unique role. The smaller rat is now duty bound to invite his larger friend to play, and the\nlarger rat is duty bound to accept the invitation. The former will jump around playfully, to\nindicate his intent. The larger rat might hang back and act cool and a bit dismissive (as is\nnow his prerogative); but if he’s a decent sort he will join in the fun, as in his heart of hearts\nhe truly wants to play. However—and this is the critical issue—if the larger rat does not let\nthe smaller rat win the repeated wrestling matches some substantial proportion of the time\n(Panksepp estimated 30 to 40 percent of the time), the smaller rat will stop exhibiting\ninvitations to play. It is just not any fun for the little guy. Thus, if the larger rat dominates\nwith power (like a bully), as he could, then he will lose at the highest level (the level where\nthe fun continues for the longest possible time), even while he “wins” more frequently at the\nlower. What does this imply? Most important, that power is simply not a stable basis upon\nwhich to construct a hierarchy designed to optimally govern repeated interactions. And this\nis not just true for rats. Alpha males among at least certain primate groups are far more\nprosocial than their lesser comrades. Power doesn’t work for them, either (see F. B. M. de\nWaal and M. Suchak, “Prosocial Primates: Selfish and Unselfish Motivations,” Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society of London: Biological Science 365 [2010]: 2711–22. See\nalso F. de Waal, The Surprising Science of Alpha Males, TEDMED 2017,\nbit.ly/primate_ethic).\n"

The same\napplies for femininity, for example, in too many places in the world: in Arabic, for example,\nthe word awrah denotes the body’s intimate parts, which must be clothed. The term’s root\nawr means something approximating “weakness,” “imperfection,” or “defectiveness.”\n“Nakedness” is the most common English translation. Other meanings include “falseness,”\n“artificiality,” or “blindness.” According to the dictionary compiled by Mohammad Moin, a\nwell-known Iranian scholar of Persian literature and Iranian studies, awrah means both\n“nakedness” or “shame” and “young woman.” In keeping with this network of ideas, the\nword awrat, derived from awrah, has been used widely in various Arabic-influenced\ncultures to signify “woman.” It is for such reasons that women are viewed by those who\nfollow the Wahhabi strand of Islam, for example—ultraconservative, austere, and\npuritanical—as sufficiently responsible for the evil and temptation of the world that their\nmovements must be drastically and severely restricted, even that they are not allowed to\nshow themselves in any important manner in the public sphere.\n"

You may well\nlive to regret it. It takes very little to accrue a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the conditions\nthat prevail in an overloaded mental health system—and once the diagnosis has been\nestablished, it is very hard to shake. It is difficult, personally, not to take a medical\ndescription seriously. It is harder than you might think to disbelieve a qualified psychiatrist\n(who should, after all, know what he or she is talking about), particularly if you are\nexperiencing strange symptoms. It is difficult practically, as well, because once such a\ndiagnosis becomes part of your permanent medical record, it is very difficult to have it\nmodified. Anything out of the ordinary about you will, from then on, attract undue\nattention (even from yourself), and any displays of normality will be downplayed. Now, I\nsay all that knowing full well that some people who have odd beliefs are in fact\nschizophrenic—but a fair bit of digging is usually in order to establish that diagnosis, and\nbusy psychiatrists in public hospitals seldom have the time for careful excavation.\n"

Pennebaker of the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, and a host of colleagues working directly with him and\nindependently, have demonstrated that writing that reduces existential uncertainty (there’s\nno simpler general way of putting it) reduces anxiety, improves mental health, and boosts\nimmunological function. All of these effects appear associated with a general decrease in\ncomplexity-induced stress and the hormones—harmful in excess—consequentially\nproduced. Pennebaker demonstrated, for example, that students who wrote for three days,\nconsecutively, about the worst events in their lives experienced, first, a decline in mood (no\ndoubt elicited by calling forth such memories) but significant improvement in their lot over\nthe period of the following months. Other researchers showed similar effects when students\nwrote about their future. Pennebaker initially assumed that it was something akin to\nemotional expression, or catharsis (following Freud), that produced these positive effects—\nthe opportunity to express anger or regret or sorrow—but found, as the result of a careful\nsemantic analysis, that it was the development of a cognitive and causal understanding of\nthe reason for the events and their significance that was curative. The effects of writing\nabout the future seemed similar, in that the plans thereby generated reduced uncertainty\nand put forward a simpler and more well-defined structure around what might otherwise\nhave been the intolerably unspecified looming weeks and months ahead.

The\nmercury is then boiled off (it has a low boiling point) so that only the gold remains. The\nproclivity of mercury for gold has given rise to the symbolic idea that the liquid metal has\nan “affinity” for what is most precious: that mercury will seek what is noble and pure and\nincorruptible—like gold itself, speaking symbolically once again—and concentrate it in\nusable amounts. So, the fundamental idea is that the pursuit of meaning, guided by\nMercury, messenger of the gods (the unconscious, as far as modern people are concerned),\nwill enable the Seeker to collect what is, like gold, of the highest value.

And this representation in the mythological\nworld is more accurate than the objective, in the experiential manner described previously:\nNature, for example, is Creator and Destroyer, just as Culture is Protector and Tyrant. It\nmight be objected: Nature and Culture are not singular things. They can be differentiated,\nso that their paradoxical components are separated, understood, and dealt with. This is all\ntrue: but the paradoxical components are often experienced simultaneously and so unified.\nThis occurs when anyone is betrayed, for example, in a love affair. Beast and man, Medusa\nand beloved woman are often united experientially in the same hypothetically unitary\nfigure. This can be a terrible discovery when made in real life.\n"

        "content": "*It has been known for decades, explicitly (and forever, implicitly) that self-initiated\nconfrontation with what is frightening or unknown is frequently curative. The standard\ntreatment for phobias and anxiety is therefore exposure to what is feared. That treatment is\neffective—but the exposure must be voluntary. It is as if the anxiety systems of the brain\nassume that anything that is advanced upon must not be a predator (or, if it is a predator, it\nis the sort that can be easily kicked to the side and defeated). We now know that even the\nemotional and bodily response to stress differs completely when that stress is voluntarily\nfaced rather than accidentally encountered. In the latter case, the threatened individual\ntenses up and readies him or herself defensively (see M. D. Seery, “Challenge or Threat?\nCardiovascular Indexes of Resilience and Vulnerability to Potential Stress in Humans,”\nNeuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews 35 [2011]: 1603–4). That can become the\nchronically unhealthy posture of someone turned to stone. In the former case, the\nindividual takes on the role of probable victor, and advances forthrightly. Such actions are\nindeed what has always saved humanity from the terrors of the night (and the evil lurking\nin the human heart). Our continual observation of that fact, over millennia, is what\nallowed us to represent it, abstractly, in our great religious stories, and then to imitate it,\nwithin the confines of our particular and unique life.\n"

I made the case in the Overture, in Rule I, in 12\nRules for Life, and in Maps of Meaning that chaos tends to find its representation in\nsymbolic form as feminine—but here I am talking about chaos, in serpentine guise. I can\nexplain this by elaborating on my explanation about the alchemical picture we discussed\nearlier—by reading it from the top down, however, this time. The more profound the threat\n—the deeper the chaos—the more likely that it will represent itself as mankind’s most\nancient enemy, the serpent. Perhaps it can be thought of like this: the unknown unknowns\n—those elements of being that are foreign and dangerous beyond imagination, and whose\nmanifestation can kill or destroy psychologically—are those most likely to be represented in\nserpentine form. Out of this domain, which is in some important sense even more\nfundamental than sex itself, emerges the primordial feminine and masculine, although it\nseems that the feminine nonetheless retains a more primary connection with the\nfundamental unknowable itself. I think this has to do primarily with the absolute mystery\nof birth: with the relationship between the emergence of new forms from the feminine and\nthe emergence of new forms from the absolutely unknown. It is perhaps something of this\nsort that accounts for the primacy of the relationship between the snake in the Garden of\nEden and Eve, rather than between the snake and Adam. Perhaps, as well (and I am\nspeculating wildly here, trying to move beyond my ignorance, trying to account for the\nclear and omnipresent symbolic relationship), it has forever been the case that females\nattract snakes (as well as other dangerous predators), most particularly when they are\ntaking care of their young, and that the heightened danger they therefore face has burned\nthe danger of the feminine in relationship to the serpentine forever in our imagination. This\nwould imply that the decision to take on a relationship with a female brings with it\nincreased exposure to the terrible unknown (something that seems clearly true in the case\nof all the threats that are faced by children), as perhaps does the fact of being female itself.\nNow the female is also a rejecting force (particularly among humans, where the females\nare very choosy maters [see, for example, Y. Bokek-Cohen, Y. Peres, and S. Kanazawa,\n“Rational Choice and Evolutionary Psychology as Explanations for Mate Selectivity,”\nJournal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology 2 (2008): 42–55]). That holding\nof the power of ultimate rejection makes Nature in all its cruelty (and, it must be said,\nwisdom). Perhaps that is also a nontrivial contributor to the feminine-serpent relationship.\n"
